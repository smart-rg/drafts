#Stopping Malware and Researching Threats (SMART) Proposed Research Group Charter

The Stopping Malware and Researching Threats Research Group (or SMART RG) will research attacks and defence methods where these relate to newly developed and existing network protocols, including those protocols published by the IETF. 
Every work item in this group will fall in one of four categories:

1. Bootstrapping papers on principles/key concepts in attack defence, to underpin attack defence research of protocols

2.	Creating methodologies for researchers to consistently analyse protocols for attack defence, and use these to perform such analysis

3.	Research on attacks or defences enabled or disabled by IETF protocols, and recommending protocol design fixes or considerations as a result – including privacy considerations

4. 	Identify specific security research problems outside of the above three points.

## BACKGROUND
The IRTF is in a unique position to do research and establish evidence on how network protocols enable or disable malware and other threats. This group will describe and characterise the effect of protocol changes on attacks, defences and the threat landscape. Once the existing landscape is established, we aim to stimulate methodical research into attack defence methods and assessments for new protocols. Protocols are already rigorously assessed for certain security properties, yet researching how protocols relate to attacks and defences is a valuable but under-researched field. This group would begin that work.

## GOALS
This research group has these major goals: 

- To research the rich area where new protocols are designed and deployed, and used by malicious actors. This includes attacks, the new ecosystem created by new protocols, defence mechanisms used or obsoleted by new protocols, and malicious actor methodology where network protocols play a role in the attack chain.
- To create **researched and referenceable** material for designers of protocols about the ecosystem in which protocols exist (such as what can be reasonably expected by endpoint security solutions and the communication lifecycle of malware), which are external to protocol design but directly relate to protocol design decisions and assertions.

## OUTPUTS
The research group plans to create documents that may include problem statements, use cases, case studies, methodologies, surveys, foundational materials in the area and research results. They will be written for use and interest of other groups. 

Two such foundational materials are **Endpoint Capabilities and Limitations** – to evidence to protocol designers what is possible and realistic on the endpoint security-wise, and what is not – and **Malware Attack Lifecycle** – a foundation to show where the interaction of IETF protocols is (and is not) in a full attack chain, allowing further analysis.

SMART meetings may contain informational content for protocol designers to broaden their understanding of the threat landscape, which is not intended to be published into the form of Internet Drafts. This informational content could include summarised statistics on volume of attacks and threats,  detection techniques and their success, including their effectiveness on different versions of protocols and attack mitigation techniques.

## MEMBERSHIP
Membership is open to any interested parties who intend to remain current with the published documents and mailing list issues. Wide participation from industry, academia, government and non-profits is encouraged.
